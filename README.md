### Creating a Simple To-Do List Web Application

## Instructions:

1- Create an HTML file with a heading, a form, and an empty list where the to-do items will be displayed.

2- Add an input field and a button to the form.

3- Link the HTML file to a CSS file using the LINK tag in the HEAD section of the HTML file.

4- In the CSS file, add styles to the form, input, and button to make them look nice.

5- Add a JavaScript file and link it to the HTML file using the SCRIPT tag.

6- In the JavaScript file, select the form, input field, and button and add an event listener to the button that will create a new list item with the text entered in the input field when the button is clicked.

7- Add a delete button to each list item that will remove the item from the list when clicked.

8- Save the files and open the HTML file in a web browser to test your to-do list web application.


## Note: 

This is just one way to create a to-do list web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can customize the styles and functionality to fit your needs and experiment with more advanced features like data persistence and filtering.
